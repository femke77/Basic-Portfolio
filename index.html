                I graduated with a BS in Computer Science last year, with honors, and I am eagerly looking forward to putting my skills to work.
                I am currently enrolled in UCLA Extension's Full Stack Boot Camp, as I want to work in web development, but never got a chance to take
                those classes during my degree track. I love learning! I want to be learning new things until the day I die. Other things I love include
                my family, my cat, baking, cooking, and CAKE. Life is just better with cake.
